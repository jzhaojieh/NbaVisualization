He casued the month long sensation known as 'Linsanity' back in 2016, where he had a strech of games where he burst onto the scene. Since then his skill has tapered off, but he has maintained his popularity with Asian-Americans, and across seas in Asia. \n",
    "The other player, who was in the underpopular group, is Kyle Lowery who is 31 years old. He is an outlier in this group, because he only started to play at such a high level in the latter part of his career. These two players were thus removed from our future analysis of the two populations.\n",

    "\n",
    "We went and manually gathered this information from basketball-reference.com. Since, wins above replacement data has only been kept for the past few seasons we used a similar statistic called win shares (WS). If a player had yet to turn 25 we just used the WS from their most recent full season. In the data below the group 'veteran' referes to the overpoular players, and 'young' refers to the underpopular players. "

    "The key takaway from our analysis is that generally, older players are overpaid, and younger players are underpaid. It's understandable why young players are underpaid, due to the fact that they are on a set contract when they get drafted, which can't be negotiated, and veterans get to negotiate their contracts with the team of their choice. However, our analysis does suggest that teams maybe should invest in younger players over older ones to gain more value. "

On the left side we saw teams represented by larger rectangles valued higher, and on the right side we saw lesser valued teams as smaller rectangles. We noticed that the color gradient seemed to show that higher valued teams also had better attendance and realized that ticket sales represented a large portion of revenue that each team took in each season. Based on this data, we saw that market size and ELO rating of teams positively correlated with fan attendance, which was a determining factor in the overall valuation of NBA teams. Based on these findings NBA teams should also take into account a player's fan base and social media presence in addition to their basketball statistics when signing players, as a player with a larger number of fans can potentially increase the teams total value. These statistics also help explain why small market professional teams are moving locations, as it allows them to tap into new markets and increase their fan base."
